/*
Have the function OptimalAssignments(strArr) read
strArr which will represent an NxN matrix and it will
be in the following format: ["(n,n,n...)","(...)",...]
where the n's represent integers. This matrix represents
a machine at row i performing task at column j.
The cost for this is matrix[i][j].
Your program should determine what machine should perform
what task so as to minimize the whole cost and it
should return the pairings of machines to tasks
in the following format: (i-j)(...)... Only one machine
can perform one task. For example: if strArr is ["(5,4,2)","(12,4,3)","(3,4,13)"]
then your program should return (1-3)(2-2)(3-1) because assigning the machines
to these tasks gives the least cost. The matrix will range from 2x2 to 6x6,
there will be no negative costs in the matrix, and there will always be a unique answer.
